A module dedicated to implementing various subsystems that aren't part of the pf2e system or popular modules such as pf2e toolbelt or pf2e workbench.

* Reputation
* Influence
* Infiltration
* Research
* Chases
* Victory Points

Other subsystems like hexploration and leadership (I believe) are covered by modules, but if there's enough demand after I've finished these subsystems, I may add them.
